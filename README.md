# ðŸ§¬ ResPathExplorer

A modular Python library for functional analysis of microbial genes using curated bioinformatics databases. This tool supports gene mapping to KEGG pathways, resistance profiles via CARD, and virulence factors through VFDB â€” providing a comprehensive view of microbial functionality in contexts such as immunology, food safety, and antimicrobial resistance.

## Key Features

- Functional Mapping: Annotate genes using KEGG, CARD, and VFDB.

- Enrichment Analysis: Perform pathway enrichment from ranked gene lists.

- Pathway-Level Analysis: Visualize gene distribution across biological pathways.

- Resistance & Virulence Profiling: Contextualize resistance and virulence genes functionally.

- Custom Data Input: Supports gene lists and annotation tables in standard formats.

- Extensible Pipeline: Modular design for easy integration into broader omics workflows.

- Visualization Tools: Built-in plots for resistance profiles, virulence categories, enrichment results, and KEGG pathways.
